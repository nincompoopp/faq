**#1 What is KETSU?**
> KETSU is a modular app that outputs video, images & text. KETSU is empty by itself until you import modules.


**#2 How do I download KETSU?**
> IMPORTANT: KETSU is only available for Apple users (iPhone, IPad, Mac.) To install the latest version of KETSU, follow the tutorial [here.](http://ketsu.app/download.html)


**#3 Is there a walkthrough for KETSU?**
> To find the walkthrough, open KETSU, tap the three lines on the top left [≡], tap settings, and scroll down until you find “Reset Tutorials.” Then, refresh your app and reopen it.


**#4 What are modules?**
> Modules are scripts that give the content and functionality to the app. Modules are made and shared by the users. KETSU DOES NOT DISTRIBUTE OR GIVE MODULES.


**#5 How do I add modules?**
> Modules are created and shared by the users. You can find them by asking around the discord or searching for them on the internet. 


**#6 My module isn’t working?**
> If a module unexpectedly stops working, KETSU is not the problem. Modules rarely break, but when they do, be patient. The module makers will fix them. What you can do in the meantime is switch to another module.


**#7 What are the benefits to buying premium?**
> Unlimited tickets: Download as many things as you want... no limit! Ad-free: Removal of ALL ads so you can have the best experience with KETSU! Cloud favorites: You can save your favorites to the cloud and share them between multiple devices. Future Proof: You’ll get access to all the premium features that will be added in the future.


**#8 How much is premium/ how do I buy it?**
> Premium is a one-time payment of $10. If you downloaded KETSU from the AppStore, you won’t be able to buy premium as the app was removed. To get premium, you’ll first have to download the latest version of KETSU. This can be found in #2.


**#9 How do I make a module?**
> All information about module making is found on the module documentation site. <https://appketsu.github.io/KETSU-Documentation/>

**#10 Should I download the IPA KETSU if I already have the AppStore version?**
> The choice is yours. IPA KETSU has more features, allows you to buy premium, and is being updated regularly unlike the AppStore version.

**#11 Why didn’t the AltStore download work?**
> Make sure you followed the tutorial correctly. This discord server does not offer tech support for AltStore. 

**#12 Why aren’t tickets working?**
> Tickets are currently inconsistent and glitchy. All you can do is be patient until they’re fixed.

**#13 Is (…) out on KETSU yet?**
> KETSU does not have any content. If a module is missing something, simply use a different module. 


**#14 I bought premium on the AppStore version, how do I get it on the IPA?**
> If you bought premium from the AppStore version, unfortunately, you’ll have to buy it again on the IPA.
